# course-api
This is an API using spring boot to encapsulate spring application.I have used Java 1.8 and spring boot 1.4.2.
Used Maven to for dependencies.And used pivotal TC as the server.

This API consists some courses along with their description to make some GET,POST calls from the UI to the backend.
